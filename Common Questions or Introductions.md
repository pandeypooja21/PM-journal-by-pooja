# What is Product Managemnt 
- Product management is a multifaceted discipline that forms the backbone of any technology organization. As a product manager, individuals are responsible for guiding the success of a product and leading the cross-functional team that is responsible for improving it. This entails an understanding of the market, the competitive landscape, customer demand and preferences, as well as business strategy. The decisions made by the product manager directly influence the strategic direction, design, functionality, and commercial success of the product. They essentially form a bridge between different teams, such as engineering, design, marketing, sales, and customer support, ensuring a sea

# Difference between Product  Management and Project Management 
## what they do?
- Product managers and project managers often work together, but they have separate and distinct roles. Whilst a product manager sets the vision, goals, and business trajectory of a product, a project manager leads the many projects to make those goals a reality. So if the product manager is a strategic thinker, the project manager is more of a doer.
- It might help if we distinguish products from projects. A product refers to any service or item that an organisation creates to serve a customer need. Products can be physical, like furniture or clothing, or digital, like an app, or a video feature on a website. A project, on the other hand, is a set of tasks completed to achieve an outcome. A project's goal could be to create or maintain a productâ€”like constructing a house, or rolling out a new software update.
## In Simpler Terms 
- Project management focuses on planning, executing, and closing specific projects with defined objectives, timelines, and deliverables, ensuring that tasks are completed on time and within budget. It is concerned with the successful completion of a project, often involving temporary endeavors with a clear beginning and end. In contrast, product management is a continuous process that involves the entire lifecycle of a product, from ideation and development to market launch and ongoing improvements.

- Product managers are responsible for defining the product vision, strategy, and roadmap, ensuring that the product meets customer needs and business goals. They work cross-functionally with teams like engineering, marketing, and sales to deliver a product that provides value over its entire lifecycle. While project managers focus on the execution of specific initiatives, product managers concentrate on the long-term success and evolution of a product.

##Key Responsibility and Roles
- A product manager is a pivotal role that stands at the crossroads of business, technology, and user experience aspects. Their roles and responsibilities include understanding customer needs, defining and communicating product strategy, prioritizing product features, liaising with different teams such as engineering, sales and marketing to ensure seamless product development and launch, monitoring and analyzing market trends, and ultimately driving the success of the product in the market. A prodigious product manager, with a unique blend of business acuity and technical knack, can significantly impact the product's acceptance in the market and the company's bottom line.
